To anyone who reads this:

Last month, I had a dream of a terrible storm that would rend this land asunder. Brothers, it is with
a heavy heart that I must inform you that this was no dream: Our Lord Rabo sent me a vision, and I was
too foolish to understand. And today, it has come to pass: the plateau has been shattered; our
great priory still stands, but who knows for how much longer. Brother Smyth is leading our people north,
to find shelter as the storm still rages. I shall venture to the Four Priories and consult with the
other Cardinals to find a way to save our people. Find me at the Western Priory.

Written with haste at the Central Priory, seventh of the second, in the yr of our Lord 1157.

Praise be Lord Rabo.
