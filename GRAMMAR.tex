\subsection{Pronunciation, Allophony, and Stress}\label{subsec:pronunciation-allophony-and-stress}
There is not a lot of allophony in UF, save that /x/ is realised as [χ] around back vowels and [ɕ] elsewhere, e.g.
*c’húr* /xũɰ/ ‘to shrink’ is pronounced [χũˑˠ]. Furthermore, /h/ is [ç] before variants of /i/ and /y/, and [h] elsewhere.

The vast majority PF words are stressed on the last syllable of the root, e.g. *ad’hór* ‘to love’ /aˈðɔ̃ɰ/, but *b’had’hóré*
‘you (\s{pl}) love’ /βaˈðɔ̃.ɰɛ̃/. The stress is not indicated in writing, neither in actual texts, nor in this
grammar or in dictionaries. The main exception to this are names, which are generally stressed on the first syllable,
and receive secondary stress on the last syllable,\footnote{That is, unless the name ends in an obvious suffix, in which case the last
syllable before any such suffixes receives secondary stress; however, this is generally quite rare.} e.g. *Daúvníc’h* /ˈdɔ̃ʋ̃ˌnĩx/.

The only exception to this rule are certain particles and irregular verbs, some of which have irregular stress; for instance,
the forms of *eḍ* ‘to be’ are all stressed on the first syllable. Any such words that deviate from the norm will be pointed
out in this grammar and in dictionaries.

Oral vowels before the stressed syllable are often somewhat muted or reduced, albeit still audible, and stressed vowels are lengthened if they
are nasalised, e.g. the pronunciation of *ad’hór*, which we just transcribed as /aˈðɔ̃ɰ/, is actually closer to [ɐ̯ˈðɔ̃ˠˑ].
Word-final voiceless `e` is always /ə̥/.

Oral vowels have a nasalised and nasal counterpart. /i/, /y/—which is actually [ʏ]—and /u/ do not vary in quality when nasalised. /a/ is normally [ɐ],
but becomes [ɑ] when nasalised or nasal. Similarly, /e/ becomes [ɛ], and /o/ becomes [ɔ]. Note that nasalised [ẽ] exists, but it’s
rare. The quality never changes when going from nasalised to nasal. The schwa has no nasal(lised) counterpart. Lastly, oral vowel
also have voiceless counterparts, whose quality is the same as that of the base vowel.

Furthermore, as indicated in that same example, word-final /ɰ/ is often realised as velarisation of the preceding vowel;
the same, however, is not the case for /ɰ̃/. Initial /ɰ/ is sometimes elided after words that end with /ɰ/, particularly
in particles (e.g. *rvá* ‘alas’).

\subsection{Orthography}
The spelling of most UF sounds is indicated above; the less exotic consonants are spelt as
one might expect. That is, /b, d, n, ɸ, s, z, h/ are spelt ⟨b, d, n, f, s, z, h⟩, respectively.

Several fricatives are spelt with an apostrophe followed by a ‘h’, viz. /x/ ⟨c’h⟩, /θ/ ⟨t’h⟩, /ð/ ⟨d’h⟩,
and /β/ ⟨b’h⟩. Conventional letters are used for rather unconventional sounds, mostly for diachronic reasons:
/l/ does not exist in UF, so ⟨l⟩ is either /ɮ̃/ or /ʎ̝̃/, ⟨v⟩ is /ʋ̃/, ⟨j⟩ is /ʑ/, ⟨r⟩ is /ɰ/, ⟨w⟩ is /ɰ̃/. The vowel
/y/ is spelt ⟨y⟩, and its consonantal equivalent /ɥ/ as well as nasalised /ɥ̃/ are spelt with an apostrophe, that is
⟨y’⟩ and ⟨ý’⟩. The ʁ-fricated fricatives /βʶ, ɮ̃ʶ, sʶ, ɕʶ, zʶ, ʑʶ/ are spelt ⟨v́, ł, ś, ḉ, ȷ́, ź⟩, respectively.

Double consonant letters indicate a lengthened consonant; these are rare, but they can occur in any position. The only
exception to this is ⟨rr⟩, which is not /ɰː/, but rather /ʀ/. UF does not have phonemic vowel length (though recall
that phonetic lengthening occurs in some situations), so a double vowel letter is always pronounced as two separate vowels.

The vowels are mostly spelt as one might expect; nasalised vowels are indicated by an acute, and nasal vowels by a circumflex.
The variants of /i, y, u, a, e/ are spelt with ⟨i, y, u, a, e⟩ as their base letters. Nasal /ẽ/ and /ẽ̃/ as well as Schwa are
indicated by adding a dot below the ⟨e⟩; the vowel /o/ is spelt ⟨au⟩ or ⟨o⟩ for diachronic reasons;\footnote{As is always the
case in cases like this, hypercorrection is frequent, and ⟨au⟩ is often preferred word-initially, even if the
PF root was spelt with ⟨o⟩. In general, UF speakers seem to prefer ⟨au⟩ over ⟨o⟩, except word-finally and after ⟨w⟩, except
that in verb affixes, *au* is quite common word-finally. The sequence ⟨wau⟩ does not exist in UF.} in the case of
⟨au⟩, the acute and circumflex are added to the ⟨u⟩. The diphthong /au/ is spelt ⟨a’u⟩. Oral
/ɛ/ is rare and is spelt ⟨è⟩. Word-initially and word-finally, a grave instead indicates that the vowel is voiceless. Word-final
voiceless /e/ is always /ə̥/, but confusingly, it is also just spelt ⟨e⟩, since ⟨è⟩ is already /ɛ/.\footnote{Thus, a word-final ⟨e⟩
can be /e/, such as in *vvaúríhe* /ʋ̃ːɔ̃ɰĩˈhe/ ‘to remember’, or /ə̥/, such as in *dale* /daɮ̃ə̥/ ‘table’. As a rule of thumb, it is
usually /e/ at the end of verb stems—but not verb forms in general—and /ə̥/ elsewhere. Fortunately they are differentiated by a
dot below in dictionaries: *vvaúríhe* and *ḍalẹ*.}

The ‘hard’ voiced *ḅ*, *ḍ* which are pronounced exactly like their regular counterparts, are normally also spelt ⟨b⟩ and
⟨d⟩. However, the dot is commonly used in dictionaries and grammatical material to distinguish between the two
as they differ from one another in how they are lenited. Furthemore, a dot below or above a letter is commonly to indicate
a variety of different things, depending on the letter:
\begin{items}\itemsep .5ex plus .1ex minus .1ex\relax
\item a dot below in *ḅ*, *ḍ* indicates that they are the ‘hard’ variants of the letter, which are pronounced
      the same, but lenited differently;
\item a dot below in *ḷ* indicates that it is palatal /ʎ̝̃/ instead of alveolar /ɮ̃/;
\item a dot below in *ẹ* indicates that it is a schwa;
\item a dot below nasalised *ẹ́*, *ệ* indicates that they are /ẽ/, /ẽ̃/ instead of /ɛ̃/, /ɛ̃̃/;
\item a dot above in *ç̇* indicates that it is lenited /j̊/.
\end{items}

\noindent Thus, in non-grammatical writing, the following are indistinguishable:
\begin{items}\itemsep .5ex plus .1ex minus .1ex\relax
\item *l* can be palatal /ʎ̝̃/ or alveolar /ɮ̃/;
\item *e* can be a schwa, or /e/;
\item *é*, *ê* can be /ɛ̃/, /ɛ̃̃/ or /ẽ/, /ẽ̃/;
\item *ç* can be /ɕ/ or /j̊/.
\end{items}

\noindent Elided initial /ɰ/ is indicated by omitting the *r* in writing and attaching the word to the previous one with a hyphen,
e.g. *-vá* ‘alas’.

\section{Accidence}\label{sec:accidence}
\subsection{Verbal Morphology}\label{subsec:verbal-morphology}
Verbs in UF are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and voice. Verbal inflexion is mainly done
by means of concatenating a vast set of prefixes onto a verb, with the occasional suffix and circumfix making
its appearance. This chapter details these affixes, their meanings, uses, forms, and restrictions.


\subsubsection{Active/Passive Affixes}\label{subsubsec:active-passive-affixes}
UF has a set of active/subject as well as passive/object prefixes which can be used on their own or in combination
with one another, though at most one active and one passive prefix may be combined with a verb.\footnote{Irrespective
of whether they are personal or infinitive prefixes. For instance, it would also be illegal to combine e.g. the active
infinitive prefix with the first person active singular prefix.} Table~\ref{tab:active-passive-prefixes}
below lists those prefixes, two of which are actually circumfixes.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Active (left) and passive (right) verbal affixes.}\label{tab:active-passive-prefixes}
\end{table}

\noindent A great degree of syncretism can be observed in the third-person forms. The gender distinction in the
\s{3sg} that diachronically resulted from gendered personal pronouns is almost non-existent in the
plural; the reason for this development is that those forms are derived from the old dative form, which lacked
this distinction altogether.

The \s{act 1pl, 2pl} forms are only distinguished from their passive counterparts by
the presence of additional suffixes in the former. The \s{3sg n} in the active and passive is derived from the PF
demonstrative \**ce* and its variants; the \s{3pl n} is derived from the other \s{3pl} forms.

The \s{1pl} prefix varies if there is a vowel following it: if it is
any vowel that is not a variant of ‘o’, the prefix is realised as *r-* instead, e.g. *ad’hór* ‘love’ to
*rad’hóró* ‘we love’. If the vowel a variant of ‘o’, the prefix is realised as *w-* instead, e.g. *aub’heír* ‘obey’
to *wob’heíró* ‘we obey’.\footnote{Diachronically, the base form of this prefix is \**o-*, whence e.g.
\**oad’hóró* > *rad’hóró* and \**oob’heíró* > *wob’heíró*.} Note that this also leads to a change in spelling: stem-initial
⟨au⟩ is changed to ⟨o⟩.

The \s{inf pass} prefix *à-* coalesces with any vowel following it: it becomes *á* if it
is followed by a non-nasal variant of ‘a’, e.g. *ad’hór* to *ád’hór* ‘to be loved’; *â* if it is
followed by a nasal variant of ‘a’, e.g. *ánvé* ‘give life to’ to *ânvé* ‘to be animated’; and *h-* if it is
followed by any other vowel, e.g. *aub’heír* to *haub’heír* ‘to be obeyed’.

The parenthesised vowels are used if the prefix is followed by a consonant, e.g. *dír* ‘say’ to *llẹ{}dír*
‘they (\s{f}) say’ and *b’hydíré* ‘you (\s{pl}) say’, but *ad’hór* to *llad’hór* ‘they (\s{f}) love’ and *b’had’hóré* ‘you
(\s{pl}) love’. The prefixes *aú-* and *à-* retain their main forms if followed by a consonant,
e.g. *dír* ‘say’ to *aúdíró* ‘We say’ and *àdír* ‘to be said’. The exception to this is that \s{2pl} *b’h(y)-*
drops the *y* if followed by a glide, e.g. *y’ír* ‘to hear’ to *b’hy’íré* ‘you (\s{pl}) hear’ (not \**b’hyy’íré*).

The *y’* in the suffix parts of the \s{1pl, 2pl act} are dropped if the verb ends with a consonant, e.g. *ad’hór*
to *b’hád’hóré*, or if it ends with a vowel that is a variant of ‘o’ in the case of the \s{1pl} and ‘e’ in the case
of the \s{2pl}, in which cases the vowels are contracted and a level of nasalisation is added, e.g. *vvaúríhe*
‘to remember’ to *b’hyvvaúríhé* ‘you (\s{pl}) remember’ (not \**b’hyvvaúríhy’é*). In all other cases, the *y’* is retained,
e.g. *aúvvaúríhey’ó* ‘we remember’.

When multiple prefixes are used together, active prefixes precede passive prefixes, except that infinitive prefixes
always come first, e.g. *ad’hór* ‘love’ to *jvad’hór* ‘I love myself’ (not \**vjad’hór*) and *b’hy’ad’hóré* ‘you (\s{pl}) love him/her’,
but *dẹvad’hór* ‘to love me’ and *àb’had’hóré* ‘to be loved by you (\s{pl})’. Recall that at most one infinitive prefix
may be used.

By way of illustration, consider the paradigm of the verb *ad’hór* as shown in Table~\ref{tab:adhor-paradigm} below.
Since this word starts with a vowel, the parenthesised vowels in Table~\ref{tab:active-passive-prefixes} above
are not used. Furthermore, since it starts with a non-nasal ‘a’-like vowel, the *aú-* prefix is realised as *r-*
and the *à-* prefix coalesces with the initial ‘a’ of the stem to form *á*.

\subsection{Tense and Aspect Marking}\label{subsec:tense-and-aspect-marking}
Tense in PF is marked by additional sets of affixes that are appended to the verb in addition to the active/passive affixes.
There are two broad groups of such affixes: suffixes, which are appended to the end of the verb and replace the \s{act 1pl, 2pl} suffixes
in those persons, as well as circumfixes and prefixes, which are inserted before the active/passive markers and replace the
replace the \s{act 1pl, 2pl} suffixes in some cases.


\subsubsection{Suffixed Tenses}
The present anterior and preterite are formed by appending a set of suffixes to the verb. Table~\ref{tab:present-anterior-and-preterite-suffixes}
below lists the suffixes for those tenses. The present anterior has a perfective aspect, while the preterite has an imperfective aspect. The
former is commonly used to describe events that are completed—particularly events that occurred recently, hence the name—while the latter
is used to describe events that are ongoing or habitual.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Present Anterior and Preterite Affixes.}\label{tab:present-anterior-and-preterite-suffixes}
\end{table}

\noindent Neither tense distinguishes gender in the third person. All suffixes, except for the infinitive and \s{1pl, 2pl pret},
lenite any consonant *before* them, e.g. *ḅárḍáḍ* ‘to be willing’ to *jḅárḍát’hé* ‘I was willing’ but *dẹḅárḍáḍá*
‘to have been willing’.

Diachronically, the \s{1sg pret} is an interesting case; in EUF, it was originally \**-é*, but it later changed to *-á*
to distinguish it from the \s{2sg, 3sg pres ant}. The remaining forms—save the infinitives, which are derived from the
tenses’ definite endings by analogy—originated from the PF simple past tenses.

The table below lists the example paradigm of the verb *ad’hór* in the present anterior and preterite tenses.
Observe that there is no difference between the \s{1pl, 2pl} active and passive.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Future I}
The future tenses, that is, the Future, Future Anterior (a tense similar to the future perfect), as well
as the Conditional, are formed by adding prefixes to the present forms. The prefix is the same in all persons and numbers,
except that there is a separate prefix for the infinitive.

In the Future, much to the UF learner’s dismay, this prefix can go in two separate positions: either before the person marker(s) or
inbetween the person marker(s) and the stem. The former case is more common in speech, while the later is more literary
and strongly preferred in writing and poetry as well as in formal speech. But even in informal speech, the Future I alone
will still not be enough to get by, as the Conditional, a *very* common tense, is formed using the Future II.

First, let us examine the former, simpler case, commonly called the Future I. The prefix is *aú-* if the verb form
after it starts with a consonant (except glides), *aúr-* in all other cases; e.g. *aújad’hór* ‘I shall love’, but
*aúrý’ad’hór* ‘it will love’. In the infinitive passive, it
contracts with the initial *à-* or *á-* to *áu* or *aû*, e.g. *aûd’hór* ‘to be about to be loved’.\footnote{This form
has no direct equivalent in English and is fairly hard to translate on its own.} No contraction happens
if the infinitive starts with *â*, e.g. *aúrânvé* ‘to be about to be animated’. Since
there is little point in writing a table for just the prefixes, Table~\ref{tab:adhor-paradigm-future-1} instead shows the Future I paradigm
of the verb \emph{ad’hór}.

\caption{Future I Paradigm of the Verb \emph{ad’hór}.}\label{tab:adhor-paradigm-future-1}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Future II}
The Future I paradigm is fairly straight-forward; unfortunately, the Future II is a lot worse: not only do the affixes
vary a lot more, but they are different depending on whether verb form following them starts with a vowel or a consonant.\footnote{This is
not a problem in the Future I, since the prefix is never adjacent to the stem.}
The vocalic and consonantal Future II affixes are shown in Tables~\ref{tab:future-2-vocalic}~and~\ref{tab:future-2-consonantal} below, respectively.

The diachrony of these forms is somewhat unclear. It would appear, however, that they result from a coalescence
of the personal pronouns with forms of some auxiliary (likely PF *avoir* and *aller*) as well as the PF future. It appears that
the \s{2sg} is derived from the formal PF \s{2pl} pronoun, which is in line with the fact that the Future II is generally
considered more formal than the almost colloquial Future I. The *v́* in the \s{2pl act} seems to be the result of metathesis.

\end{table}

\noindent
Many verbs have a different future stem that is used in all future tenses (except the Future I); for example, the future
stem of *vvaúríhe* ‘to remember’, is *vvaúríźe*; thus, we have
*jvvaúríhe* ‘to remember’ but *jaúvvaúríźẹ́* ‘I shall remember’. Note also that these forms already include the
active/passive affixes, which is why it’s *jaúvvaúríźẹ́* and not \**jaújvvaúríźẹ́* or \**jjaúvvaúríźẹ́*.
As in the present, the dictionary form of the future
stem is a verbal noun; thus, *vvaúríźe* roughly means ‘the act of being about to remember’.\footnote{As noted before, infinitive
and gerund forms of future tenses are difficult to translate into English.}

The future stem usually ends with a vowel, which is dropped if any future suffix or a suffix that starts with a vowel is added, e.g.
*laúvvaúríźaú* ‘they will remember’, not \**laúvvaúríźeaú*. Note that in the case of future suffixes, even those that start
with a consonant cause the vowel to be dropped. The only exception to this is the suffix *-ẹ*, which is dropped instead,
e.g. *aúrvvaúríźe* ‘she will remember’, not \**aúrvvaúríźẹ*.

At the same time, initial *r* in Future II suffixes is dropped if the
last consonant before the final vowel of the future stem is *w*, or an ʁ-coloured consonant such as *ź*, e.g.
*laúvvaúríźe* ‘they will be remembered’, not \**laúvvaúríźre*. If the last consonant of the future stem is *r*, since
any following vowel (whether nasalised or not) is deleted when a Future II suffix is added, the final *r* of the stem and
the initial *-r* of the Future II suffixes that have one coalesce to *rr*, e.g. *b’haý’ad’hórérre* ‘you (\s{pl}) will
love’.

Some future stems are nasalising, which is the case if the final vowel is a nasal vowel; in such cases, the vowel
is still dropped if a suffix is added, but if that suffix starts with a vowel, nasalisation is applied to it, e.g.
in the case of *dír*, whose future stem is *dírẹ́*, we have *aúnraûdíraû* ‘we shall say’: the *-aú* suffix is merges
with the nasalisation of the final vowel to become *aû*. The Future II *-ẹ* desinence becomes *-ẹ́* for such verbs,
e.g. *aúrdírẹ́* ‘he will say’, and \s{1sg fut pass} vocalic *-é* becomes *-ê*.

Note that when more than one affix is used, at most one can be a future affix, e.g. *jaúsyvvaúríźẹ́* ‘I shall remember it’
and not \**jaúsaúrvvaúríźẹ́*. Generally, the active prefix will be the future affix, but it is possible to use the
passive future affixes instead for emphasis e.g. *jy’aúrvvaúríźe* roughly ‘him, I shall remember’; often, this is
also used to aid in establishing a contrast to some other part of the sentence that does not have this inversion.

Since some of the passive future affixes also have suffix parts—unlike the present affixes, where the passive forms are
all prefixes—we can end up with multiple suffixes in addition to multiple prefixes, in which case active prefixes, instead
of simply preceding the passive ones, can be thought of as effectively ‘wrapping’ them, e.g. *aúlaúvvaúríźey’ó* ‘we shall
remember them’, which contains *laúvvaúríźe* ‘they will be remembered’.

Finally, as always, infinitive prefixes come first. If combined with other affixes, it will generally be the future affix,
e.g. *haúlývvaúríźe* roughly ‘to be about to remember them’ but, as with passive affixes, variations are possible for emphasis
or contrastive power, e.g. *dẹlaúvvaúríźe*, which puts more emphasis on ‘them’.

Table~\ref{tab:future-2-adhor} below shows the complete (vocalic) Future II paradigm of the verb *ad’hór* ‘to love’, and
Table~\ref{tab:future-2-vvaurihe} the complete (consonantal) Future II paradigm of II *vvaúríhe* ‘to remember’; recall
that the future stems of these verbs are *ad’hórérẹ́* and *vvaúríźe*.

\caption{Paradigm of the verb \emph{eḍ}.}\label{tab:ed-paradigm}
\end{table}

\noindent The etymology of these forms is mostly from a gradual simplification of coalesced forms of the personal
pronouns with the PF copula. To compensate for the fact that PF lacks certain forms that are present in UF, some
of the forms were coined by analogy. For instance, the \s{pres ant inf} *éfyḍ* is derived from the \s{pres ant}
stem \**fy* and the \s{pres inf} *éḍ*, and the same is true for the \s{pret inf} *ét’hẹd*.

For obvious reasons, the copula lacks passive forms. At the same time, the first person forms are manifestly
derived from the first person passive pronoun, for unknown reasons.

Unlike nearly every other word in the language, all forms of the copula are summarily stressed on the first
syllable.

\subsection{Noun Morphology}\label{subsec:noun-morphology}
UF has 4 declensions. A definite and indefinite vocalic declension, and a definite and indefinite consonantal declension.
As their names might suggest, the former two are used for nouns that start with a vowel, and the latter two for nouns
that start with a consonant. UF has no morphologically separate articles; rather, the old PF articles have been incorporated
into the declensions. Furthermore, UF no longer has a gender distinction in nouns.

\subsubsection{Declension}
The table below shows the affixes of the definite and indefinite declensions. The declensions are mostly identical,
except that, as with the conjugation of verbs, the consonantal prefixes often end in a vowel (marked below with
parentheses), which are not present in the vocalic declension.

\noindent Most of these forms cause lenition in the initial consonant of the noun, e.g. *ḍalẹ* ‘table’ to
\s{def acc sg} *s’thalẹ*; this lenition is blocked in the \s{indef acc pl} due to the presence of a hypercorrected ‘s’
in PF \**ces*, e.g. *s’ḍalẹ* ‘the tables (\s{acc})’ (not *s’thalẹ*, which is the singular), as well as in
less commonly used forms such as the \s{def} inessive *dwáḍalẹ* ‘on the table’.

The \s{indef nom sg} *ŷn-* prefix and some other forms nasalise nouns; as a reminder, this means that in
nouns starting with *ḍ*, the *ḍ* is deleted, e.g. *ŷnalẹ* ‘a table’;
it causes nasalisation in words that start with a vowel e.g. *ehyó* ‘shield’ to *ŷnéhyó* ‘a shield’. The indefinite vocative
does not exist, as that would make little sense. As lenition, nasalisation too is blocked in rarer forms, e.g. \s{indef} inessive
*dáhŷnḍalẹ* ‘on a table’.

The diachrony of these forms is mostly from the PF definite and indefinite pronouns, though some forms, such as the
accusative, are borrowed from demonstratives instead (\s{def} from PF \**celui* and \s{indef} from PF \**ce*); the definite
partitive forms are from the PF partitive article, and
the indefinite forms are formed with an additional *d-* by analogy to the definite forms. The locative cases are combinations
of the articles and PF prepositions.
